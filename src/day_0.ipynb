    "## What is this Advent of Code anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to all this, welcome! [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual Christmas themed puzzle calendar for programmers. Every day, it provides you with a puzzle that consists of a description and text input. Your task is to find a (usually numeric) solution by any way you want â€“ often by writing code that reads the input, performs actions and prints out the solution. If you get it correct, you'll get a second part of the puzzle that usually builds on top of the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have written down [tips based on my many years with these puzzles](https://hamatti.org/posts/tips-for-advent-of-code/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I solve these daily puzzles with Python, using just standard library (and Jupyter Notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "While solving them, I write about my solutions, aim to write beginner-friendly code and explain my solutions and the standard library tools I use.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to help people new to programming and new to Python to learn new things while having fun with helping Santa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you decide to crack these puzzles yourself or are just reading along to learn more about Python, software development and puzzle solving, welcome along the journey with me."
