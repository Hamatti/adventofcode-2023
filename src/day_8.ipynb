    "> # Day 8: Haunted Wasteland\n",
    "> \n",
    "> You're still riding a camel across Desert Island when you spot a sandstorm quickly approaching. When you turn to warn the Elf, she disappears before your eyes! To be fair, she had just finished warning you about ghosts a few minutes ago.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> One of the camel's pouches is labeled \"maps\" - sure enough, it's full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe some kind of network of labeled nodes.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> It seems like you're meant to use the left/right instructions to navigate the network. Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you can escape the haunted wasteland!\n",
    "> \n",
    "> After examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out: AAA and ZZZ. You feel like AAA is where you are now, and you have to follow the left/right instructions until you reach ZZZ.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> This format defines each node of the network individually. For example:\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">RL\n",
    ">\n",
    ">AAA = (BBB, CCC)\n",
    ">BBB = (DDD, EEE)\n",
    ">CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)\n",
    ">DDD = (DDD, DDD)\n",
    ">EEE = (EEE, EEE)\n",
    ">GGG = (GGG, GGG)\n",
    ">ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">Starting with AAA, you need to look up the next element based on the next left/right instruction in your input. In this example, start with AAA and go right (R) by choosing the right element of AAA, CCC. Then, L means to choose the left element of CCC, ZZZ. By following the left/right instructions, you reach ZZZ in 2 steps.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Of course, you might not find ZZZ right away. If you run out of left/right instructions, repeat the whole sequence of instructions as necessary: RL really means RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL... and so on. For example, here is a situation that takes 6 steps to reach ZZZ:\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">LLR\n",
    ">\n",
    ">AAA = (BBB, BBB)\n",
    ">BBB = (AAA, ZZZ)\n",
    ">ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Starting at AAA, follow the left/right instructions. How many steps are required to reach ZZZ?"

I'm not a big fan of these kind of inline if/else patterns but I feel this one is simple enough to understand that it's okay. In real life, it's a 50/50 whether I'd refactor it into something better.\n",
